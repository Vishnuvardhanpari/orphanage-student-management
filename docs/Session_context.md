---

## Milestone 1 — Project Initialization (Phases A–D)

* Root structure, Docker Postgres, Spring Boot foundation, Angular foundation, CORS/Prometheus integration

---

## Milestone 2 — Authentication (merged to `main`)

### Backend

* Flyway migrations: `roles`, `users`, `refresh_tokens`, seeded ADMIN/STAFF roles
* JPA entities/repos for User, Role, RefreshToken
* BCrypt (strength 12), JWT access tokens (HS256), opaque refresh tokens with rotation + reuse detection
* Google ID token verification (GIS → `POST /api/v1/auth/google`); no self-registration
* Account lockout after failed password attempts
* Auth APIs: login, google, refresh, logout, me
* SecurityFilterChain: stateless JWT; Swagger denied in prod
* Bootstrap admin via `AdminBootstrapRunner` when users table is empty
* Unit + integration tests for JWT and auth flows

### Frontend

* Login page (reactive form + optional Google GIS button)
* AuthService, TokenStorageService (`sessionStorage`)
* Auth interceptor with single-flight refresh on 401
* authGuard, guestGuard, roleGuard (Users = ADMIN)
* Topbar logout; sidebar hides Users for non-admins
* Unit tests for AuthService and authGuard

---

## Milestone 3 — User Management (merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `UserController` at `/api/v1/users` (ADMIN only via SecurityConfig + `@PreAuthorize`)
* List (page/search/filter), get, create, update, disable, enable, reset-password
* Soft disable only (`DELETE` aliases disable); revoke refresh tokens on disable/reset
* Safety: cannot disable/demote self; cannot disable/demote last enabled ADMIN
* Create supports LOCAL (password) and GOOGLE (no password) provisioning
* Reset password upgrades GOOGLE → LOCAL_GOOGLE
* Unit tests (`UserServiceTest`) + integration tests (`UserManagementIntegrationTest`)

### Frontend

* User list (AG Grid + server-side paging/filters/**sorting**)
* User form (create/edit)
* User details (enable/disable, reset password via CDK dialogs)
* User list actions: Angular AG Grid cell renderer with a11y labels; self-disable hidden on list
* Reset password dialog: confirm-password match validation
* UserService + models; routes under `/users` with `roleGuard`

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Users section expanded with full contracts
* Enable Staff documented in Features, Business Rules, UI UX, and AI Context

### Milestone 3 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–008)

* BUG-001–008 resolved and merged to `main`

---

## Milestone 4 — Student Database Design (merged to `main`)

### Backend

* Flyway `V4__create_students_and_documents.sql`: `students` + `student_documents`
* CHECKs for gender, status, document_type; UNIQUE admission_number / aadhaar_number
* FK `student_documents.student_id → students(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT`
* Indexes including composite `(deleted, status)`
* JPA entities: `Student`, `StudentDocument` with `@SQLRestriction("deleted = false")`
* Enums: `Gender`, `StudentStatus`, `DocumentType`
* Schema IT: `StudentSchemaIntegrationTest`
* Column `exit_remarks` added; synced into `docs/06_Database_Design.md`

---

## Milestone 5 — Student Registration (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `StorageService` abstraction: local filesystem (`local`/`dev`/`test`) and GCS HTTP API (`prod`)
* Multipart limits: 10 MB/file, 50 MB/request
* `POST /api/v1/students` (multipart) for ADMIN/STAFF
* DTOs, MapStruct mapper, repositories, file validator (extension + MIME + size + magic bytes), audit fields
* Optional photo → `profile_photo_path`; supporting docs → `student_documents`
* Flyway `V5`: case-insensitive unique index on `LOWER(admission_number)`
* Uniqueness checks include soft-deleted rows; `DataIntegrityViolationException` → 409; multipart size → `ApiErrorResponse` 400
* Cross-field rule: date of birth on or before admission date
* Unit + integration tests for registration and local storage

### Frontend

* Registration form at `/students/new` (reactive forms, sections, validation)
* Past-or-present date validators + DOB ≤ admission date; `max` on date inputs
* Photo + supporting document upload UI with preview and upload progress
* List/form navigation via `app-button` + router (no button nested in anchor)
* `StudentService.create` via `FormData` with `reportProgress`

### Milestone 5 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–009)

* BUG-001–009 resolved; branch `milestone/student-registration` completed and closed

---

## Milestone 6 — Student Profile (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `StorageService.load` for local + GCS (`?alt=media`)
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}` — full detail DTO with `hasProfilePhoto` (no storage paths)
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/documents` — active documents only
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/documents/{documentId}/download` — attachment stream
* `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/photo` — inline image stream
* CORS exposes `Content-Disposition` for cross-origin download filenames
* Unit + integration tests for profile, download, photo, 404, auth

### Frontend

* Profile page at `/students/:id` (sections, photo blob URL, documents + download)
* Post-registration navigate to `/students/{id}`
* `StudentService` getById / listDocuments / fetchPhoto / downloadDocument
* Profile Back control uses button + navigate (no nested button-in-anchor)
* Gender display uses readable labels; photo load failures surface via toast + unavailable state
* Document downloads disable all Download actions while one is in progress
* List page copy reflects M6 profiles (list/search reserved for Milestone 8)
* Component tests for profile page; `fetchPhoto` covered in StudentService specs

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Milestone 6 contracts
* Session context: M6 closed and merged to `main`

### Milestone 6 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–008)

* BUG-001–008 resolved and merged to `main`

---

## Milestone 7 — Student Update (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `UpdateStudentRequest` (no `admissionNumber`); MapStruct `updateFromDto`
* Aadhaar uniqueness excluding current student, including soft-deleted rows → `409`
* `PUT /api/v1/students/{id}` — JSON field update → `StudentDetailResponse`
* `PUT /api/v1/students/{id}/photo` — replace profile photo → `204`
* `POST /api/v1/students/{id}/documents` — add supporting docs → `201` list
* `PUT /api/v1/students/{id}/documents/{documentId}` — replace one document → `200`
* `DELETE /api/v1/students/{id}/photo` — remove profile photo → `204` (QA BUG-007)
* `DELETE /api/v1/students/{id}/documents/{documentId}` — logical document delete → `204` (QA BUG-007)
* Store-new-then-delete-old for photo/document replace; compensation on store failure
* Admission number immutable; status/exit/soft-delete not editable
* Unit tests (`StudentServiceTest`) + integration (`StudentUpdateIntegrationTest`)

### Frontend

* Edit route `/students/:id/edit` (registered before `:id`)
* `StudentFormPage` create | edit mode: prefill, read-only admission number, separate field save vs photo/doc actions
* Profile page **Edit** CTA
* `StudentService` update / replacePhoto / addDocuments / replaceDocument
* Form + service + profile Edit navigation specs

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Milestone 7 contracts (four endpoints)

### Milestone 7 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–007, issues #29–#35)

* BUG-001–007 resolved and merged to `main`

---

## Milestone 8 — Student Search (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `GET /api/v1/students` — single list/search endpoint (no separate `/students/search`)
* Query params: `search`, `gender`, `status`, `admissionYear`, `school`, `ageMin`, `ageMax`, plus `page`/`size`/`sort` (default `admissionDate,desc`, size 20)
* Global `search` matches name, admission number, Aadhaar, guardian, and phone
* `ageMin`/`ageMax` translated server-side into a `date_of_birth` range (age never persisted); `400` on negative values or `ageMin > ageMax`
* JPA Specifications (`StudentSpecifications`) for dynamic filtering; soft-deleted rows excluded by default
* `StudentSummaryResponse` list DTO; shared `PageResponse` moved to `common/dto` (old `user/dto/PageResponse` removed)
* Flyway `V6__add_students_search_indexes.sql`: index on `students(date_of_birth)` for the age-range filter
* Unit tests (`StudentServiceTest`) + integration tests (`StudentSearchIntegrationTest`)

### Frontend

* Student list page at `/students` — AG Grid with server-side pagination, sorting, and filters
* Filter panel: global search, gender, status, admission year, school, age range (min/max)
* Age column sorts via `dateOfBirth` with inverted direction; server-side sort mapping per column
* Empty states for "no students yet" vs "no matching students"; actions cell (View / Edit)

### Milestone 8 QA bug fixes (issues #37–#43)

* #37–#43 resolved and merged to `main`

---

## Milestone 9 — Student Soft Delete & Restore (completed and closed; merged to `main` via PR #54)

### Backend

* `DELETE /api/v1/students/{id}` — soft delete (`deleted`, `deletedBy`, `deletedDate`, `status=INACTIVE`); ADMIN/STAFF; `204`; already deleted → `404`. Optionally accepts a JSON body (`exitDate`, `exitReason`, `exitRemarks`) to record exit details in the same request (QA BUG-005)
* `PATCH /api/v1/students/{id}/restore` — ADMIN only; clear delete flags + `ACTIVE`; `200` detail; not deleted → `409`
* `GET /api/v1/students/inactive` — ADMIN/STAFF; paginated soft-deleted rows (native query bypasses `@SQLRestriction`); default sort `deletedDate,desc`; response rows include `deletedDate` (QA BUG-007)
* Sort whitelist for `/students` and `/students/inactive` includes `schoolName` and `standard` (QA BUG-002)
* Profile/photo/documents **reads** include soft-deleted students (archived profile)
* Mutations still require an active student → archived → `404`
* No Flyway / schema changes
* Unit tests + `StudentSoftDeleteIntegrationTest` (authz, inactive list, restore, mutations blocked, optional exit details, exit-date validation)

### Frontend

* Active list: Archive action opens `ArchiveStudentDialog` (optional exit date/reason/remarks) instead of a plain confirm; link to Archived students; Status filter removed from the active list (QA BUG-003, its value duplicated the page itself)
* `/students/inactive` archived list (ADMIN + STAFF); Restore action ADMIN-only; grid shows the `Deleted on` column (QA BUG-007)
* `/students/inactive/:id` read-only archived profile (photo + document download); Restore for ADMIN
* Active profile: Archive action via `ArchiveStudentDialog`; Edit hidden when archived
* Archived/active UI mode (`archived()`) is derived from the loaded student's `status`, not from route data (QA BUG-001); route data is only a loading-state hint
* `app-button` supports a `routerLink` input so navigation actions render a single `<a>` instead of nesting a `<button>` inside an anchor (QA BUG-004); the projected label is captured once via an `<ng-template>` and replayed into whichever branch renders via `NgTemplateOutlet`, so it survives Angular's static content-projection resolution across the `@if`/`@else` branches (QA BUG-UI-001)
* Sidebar: Archived Students; Students nav exact-match so inactive does not highlight both
* `StudentService.softDelete(id, exitDetails?)` / `restore` / `listInactive`
* Dedicated spec coverage added for the archived list page, the archive/restore dialogs, and the `Button` routerLink variant (QA BUG-006)

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Milestone 9 contracts expanded, including the optional soft-delete request body and `schoolName`/`standard` sort support
* Session context: M9 closed and merged to `main`

### Milestone 9 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–007, issues #45–#51)

* BUG-001 — Archived UI mode is now derived from `student.status` instead of static route data
* BUG-002 — `schoolName`/`standard` added to both list endpoints' sort whitelists
* BUG-003 — Status filter removed from the active student list (redundant with the list itself)
* BUG-004 — `app-button` gained a `routerLink` input; student pages no longer nest a `<button>` inside an `<a>`
* BUG-005 — `DELETE /students/{id}` now accepts an optional exit-details body; `ArchiveStudentDialog` captures it in the UI
* BUG-006 — Added missing specs for the archived list page, archive/restore dialog flows, and the `Button` routerLink variant
* BUG-007 — `deletedDate` added to `StudentSummaryResponse`/model and the archived grid

### Milestone 9 QA bug fixes, round 2 (BUG-UI-001–002, issues #52–#53)

* BUG-UI-001 — `app-button`'s `routerLink` (`<a>`) variant rendered with no visible label. Root cause: Angular resolves content projection statically at compile time, so a component template that places `<ng-content>` directly inside more than one `@if`/`@else` branch only ever projects into one of the branches (documented upstream: angular/angular#7795, #61282, #53310) — ours projected into the `<button>` `@else` branch only. Fixed in `button.html` by hoisting the projected content into a single `<ng-template #label>` and rendering it in both branches via `<ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]="label" />`; no change to the component's public API (inputs/outputs) or any of the 3 call sites (`student-list-page`, `student-inactive-list-page`)
* BUG-UI-002 — `button.spec.ts` only asserted tag type/CSS class for the `routerLink` variant, never the projected label, which is why BUG-UI-001 shipped undetected. Added label-text regression coverage (`button.spec.ts`, driven through a host wrapper component so real content projection is exercised) plus header-label assertions in `student-list-page.spec.ts` and `student-inactive-list-page.spec.ts`

### Milestone 9 closure

* Issues #45–#53 closed
* Merged to `main` via PR #54 (`e68e03c`)

---

## Milestone 10 — Reports & PDF Export (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* OpenPDF dependency; `oms.reports` config (organization name, max selected/filter limits)
* Shared `StudentSpecifications.buildListSpecification` used by list + filter export
* Exact admission lookup via additive `GET /students?admissionNumber=` (case-insensitive)
* `GET /api/v1/reports/student/{id}`, `POST /api/v1/reports/students`, `POST /api/v1/reports/filter`
* Filter export `scope`: `ACTIVE` | `ARCHIVED` | `ALL` (ReportService orchestrates active Spec vs deleted native query)
* `GET /students/inactive` accepts the same optional filters as the active list (except status/admissionNumber)
* Selected-export max enforced only in `ReportService` (config-driven; no hardcoded `@Size(max=50)`)
* `StudentPdfRenderer`: org header, student sections, profile photo, inline image docs, PDF doc references, page numbers, generated date/by
* SLF4J audit logs for report generation (persistent `audit_logs` deferred to M12)
* Unit tests (`StudentPdfRendererTest`, `ReportServiceTest`) + `ReportExportIntegrationTest`

### Frontend

* `ReportService` + blob download; Reports page (single by admission #, filtered export with scope + match-count preview, link to list for selection)
* CDK `ExportReportDialog` with filter/selection preview (`+N more` when truncated)
* Student list + archived list: AG Grid multi-select with cross-page selection map + client max-selected check + Export selected
* Student profile: Export PDF (active and archived)
* Component specs for report page, export dialog; ReportService HTTP specs

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Reports section expanded (scope, admissionNumber, inactive filters)
* `.env.example` report config keys documented

### Milestone 10 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–009, issues #55–#63)

* BUG-001 — Exact `admissionNumber` list param; Reports page no longer uses fragile contains-search `size=5`
* BUG-002 — Cross-page selection via `Map<id, StudentSummary>` on active and archived lists
* BUG-003 — Removed hardcoded `@Size(max=50)`; service uses `ReportProperties`
* BUG-004 / BUG-009 — Filter export supports Active / Archived / All; Status dropdown replaced by Scope
* BUG-005 — Client max-selected check (`environment.reportsMaxSelected`); server remains authoritative
* BUG-006 — Added report page, export dialog, and related list/service specs
* BUG-007 — Filtered export confirms with match count (and blocks over `reportsMaxFilterResults`)
* BUG-008 — Selection preview appends `+N more` when truncated

### Milestone 10 closure

* Issues #55–#63 addressed on `milestone/report-export`
* Merged to `main` via PR #64 (`cd23119`)

---

## Milestone 11 — Dashboard (completed and closed; merged to `main`)

### Backend

* `DashboardController` at `/api/v1/dashboard` (ADMIN/STAFF via `@PreAuthorize`)
* Endpoints: `GET /summary`, `GET /admissions`, `GET /gender`, `GET /status`
* `DashboardService` aggregates via `StudentRepository` (`COUNT` / `GROUP BY`; native queries bypass `@SQLRestriction` for inactive/status/admissions-including-deleted)
* Summary: total/active/inactive, new admissions (current UTC calendar month), male/female (active only), recent admissions/updates (top 5 active)
* Admissions trend: last 12 months zero-filled; includes later-archived students
* Gender chart: active roster including `OTHER`; status chart: ACTIVE vs INACTIVE across all retained rows
* No Flyway / schema changes
* Unit tests (`DashboardServiceTest`) + integration tests (`DashboardIntegrationTest`)

### Frontend

* Dashboard page replaces M11 placeholder: stat cards (Left Students label for inactive), ECharts (gender / status distribution / monthly admissions), recent lists, quick actions, skeletons, refresh
* `provideEchartsCore` scoped to dashboard page (tree-shaken echarts core: pie + bar)
* `DashboardService` + models; component + HTTP specs
* Chart colors resolved from CSS theme tokens (`--color-primary-600`, `--color-warning-600`, `--color-inactive-500`) with fallbacks
* Chart a11y: `role="img"`, `aria-label`, visually hidden value summaries
* New Admissions hint discloses UTC month window (`This month (UTC)`)

### Docs

* `docs/07_API_Design.md` Dashboard section added
* `docs/08_UI_UX.md` Dashboard section updated for shipped cards/charts/quick actions/error Retry (no longer “Charts (Future)”)

### Milestone 11 QA bug fixes (BUG-001–007, issues #65–#71)

* BUG-001 — Dashboard GETs use `SKIP_ERROR_TOAST`; empty state is the sole error UX (no multi-toast spam from `forkJoin`)
* BUG-002 — Error empty state projects **Retry** (same pattern as student list)
* BUG-003 — Charts expose `role="img"` / `aria-label` plus visually hidden text summaries
* BUG-004 — `docs/08_UI_UX.md` reflects implemented dashboard; removed Future “Dashboard Charts”
* BUG-005 — Middle chart title renamed to **Status Distribution**
* BUG-006 — ECharts colors read from theme CSS variables via `getComputedStyle`
* BUG-007 — New Admissions hint: “This month (UTC)” (UTC product decision unchanged)

### Milestone 11 closure

* Issues #65–#71 closed
* Merged to `main` via PR (see git history / GitHub)

---

# Technology Decisions

Unchanged from Milestone 1–10, plus Milestone 11 dashboard definitions:

* Soft delete/restore with optional exit payload captured at archive time (extended in QA BUG-005; no new endpoint)
* Archived list/profile readable by ADMIN and STAFF; restore ADMIN-only (STAFF read access is an explicit product decision vs Business Rules wording that emphasizes administrators for historical search)
* Active `GET /students` continues to exclude soft-deleted rows
* Document soft-delete / GCS objects are not cascaded when archiving a student
* Dashboard: “Left Students” UI = `inactiveStudents` (soft-deleted); new admissions = current UTC calendar month (UI hint: “This month (UTC)”); gender cards active-only; status chart titled **Status Distribution**

---

# Current Objective

Begin Milestone 12 — Audit Logging (planning / architecture review before implementation).

---

# Current Branch

```text
main
```

---

# Known Decisions

* PostgreSQL / Supabase / GCS / Cloud Run / Angular / Tailwind / AG Grid / ECharts / Lucide / CDK / ngx-toastr
* Spring Security + JWT + Google OAuth (GIS ID token)
* Student soft delete; no standalone document module
* No Google self-registration — users must be pre-provisioned (Milestone 3 User Management)
* `@SQLRestriction` hides soft-deleted rows by default; uniqueness and restore/inactive queries must bypass explicitly (native/`@Query`)
* Milestone 5–11 completed and merged to `main`
* Milestone 9: soft delete with optional exit details captured at archive time (QA BUG-005); ADMIN+STAFF can view archived students; only ADMIN restores
* Profile photo is never exposed as a storage path in JSON; clients fetch via authenticated photo endpoint (blob URL in UI)
* Milestone 10: PDF docs are references only; image docs embedded inline; report audit is SLF4J until Milestone 12; sync PDF download (no job queue); PDFs not persisted to GCS
* Milestone 10 filter export uses `scope` (`ACTIVE` | `ARCHIVED` | `ALL`); active path uses `GET /students` predicates; archived path uses the inactive/deleted query path; `GET /students` itself still excludes soft-deleted rows
* Milestone 11: dashboard recent rows expose `firstName`/`lastName` (not a computed `fullName`); monthly admissions use portable `EXTRACT(YEAR/MONTH)` for H2 + PostgreSQL compatibility; New Admissions window is UTC (UI discloses it)

---

# Pending Milestones

* Milestone 12 — Audit Logging
* … (see roadmap)

---

# Blockers

None.

**Local note:** Windows service `postgresql-x64-17` may occupy `5432`; OMS Docker Postgres often uses `DB_PORT=5433` in local `.env`. Low Windows paging-file memory can cause Surefire fork OOMs; use `-DforkCount=0` if needed locally.

---

# Next Session Goal

1. Read Milestone 12 scope in `docs/13_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
2. Planning + Architecture Review for Audit Logging
3. Create/switch to `milestone/audit-logging` after approval
